# ECE472: Deep Learning

## Abstract
Implemented deep learning models for regression and classification for small data analysis, computer vision, and text processing. Some popular architectures
that have been implemented are: 

 - Multilayer Perceptron 
 - ResNets
 - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
